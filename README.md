**IPL Batting and Bowling Analysis with Predictive Models**
This project performs detailed analysis and predictive modeling on IPL data. It includes batting and bowling insights, historical trends, and machine learning models to predict future performance.

**Project Overview**
This repository focuses on analyzing IPL player performances to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models for batter and bowler performances. It includes:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Preprocessing and feature engineering for meaningful analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive stats on batting, bowling, and extras.
Predictive Modeling: Using Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict player performance.
Visualizations: Comprehensive plots to understand trends and relationships in data.

**Features
Batting Analysis:**

Player-wise performance trends.
Analysis of runs scored across seasons and against specific bowlers.
**Bowling Analysis:**

Identifying top-performing bowlers.
Weighted metrics based on wickets and matches played.
**Predictive Models:**

Linear Regression: Predicts batter runs for the next season.
Random Forest: Used for comparative analysis (though not the final model).

**Extras and Trends:**
Insights into wides, no-balls, and other extras.

**Data Description**
match_id: Unique identifier for each match.
match_year: The year of the match.
batter, bowler: Players involved in each delivery.
batsman_runs: Runs scored by the batter on each ball.
is_wicket: Indicates if the batter was dismissed on a delivery.
Additional fields related to innings, extras, and dismissals.

**Methodology**
**Data Preparation:**

Removed missing values and duplicates.
Consolidated data into useful features (e.g., weighted averages for bowlers).

**Feature Engineering:**
Batting metrics: Runs scored, strike rate.
Bowling metrics: Wickets taken, economy rate.
Match conditions: Overs played, innings type.

**Model Training:**
Linear Regression: Trained on historical batter data to predict future runs.
Input features: batsman_runs, total_runs, is_wicket, over.
Target: batsman_runs.

**Visualization:**
Scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for trends.
Year-wise and player-wise performance graphs.

**How to Run**
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.7+
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

**Install dependencies using:**
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl_analysis.git
cd ipl_analysis
Run the analysis:

bash
Copy code
python ipl_analysis.py
For predictions, modify the future_batter_data DataFrame with your input values in ipl_analysis.py.

Visualizations and results are saved in the output folder.

**Results**
**Batting**
Top Batters: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and AB de Villiers emerged as consistent performers.
Predicted Runs: Linear Regression predicts Kohli's next-season average to be ~38.
**Bowling**
Top Bowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Rashid Khan, and Sunil Narine stood out.
Insights: Bowlers with lower economy rates often dominate top batter matchups.
